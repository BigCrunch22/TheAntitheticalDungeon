  description: "[i]Ahh... These are some pretty incredible objects. I can't believe
    I made them all by myself. Seeing the pathways so easily makes it quite trivial,
    but the visuals are just amazing. I wonder how many times I can expand this? This
    makes for some good brain exer... Hmmm? What kind of entity is this? Also, how
    did something manage to get inside my objects. I need to observe this.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Ugh...
    I was supposed to be navigating a virtual dungeon. What happened?[/b]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nObject

    dungeon you have stepped yourself into and get yourself out of here. Also, avoid
    extremely shady offerings from now on. It's not worth the money you're getting.\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIdea/Implementer
